Sim(ple) Ed(itor)
===
Very responsive fast text editor.

How it works?
---
It is based on multiple .Net technologies like Avalonia, AvalonEdit, AvalonDock to be a 
basic editor.

To reach faster responsitivity, it is based on .Net AOT (aka native compilation) and 
we recommend .Net 9+ for best experience.
